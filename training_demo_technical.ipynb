        "Welcome to the demo page for my project to measure local economic development using satellite imagery! In this Google Colab workbook I will explain every step taken to construct the local development index using satellite images through the U-Net architecture. As of 9/4, the model is trained on around 3400 images. When tested on a test set of around 430 images, it has achieved a 91% test set accuracy and a mean intersection-over-union score of around 90.5%.\n",

        "In the literature of subnational politics, we don't really have very micro-level measure of important qualities such as political decentralization, economic development, etc at the local level. This is very unfortunate because our theorization tends to happen on a very local scale, but then the data we have are still very aggregated.\n",

        "\n",
        "On the measurement of local economic development we run into the same issue. Economists have used two approaches two get around this issue: One is with luminosity score, which utilizes a satellite to capture images of a local area. The images are taken at night, which they theorize that more developed areas are more likely to have more nightlights than underdeveloped areas. This approach has so far been the state-of-the-art for many years in that literature. However, it does have several limitations:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Clouds can obscure the luminosity on the ground level. Some correction can be made by taking multiple images at different times and exclude cloudy ones. But if the location is prone to clouds often then the adjustment may not work.\n",
        "- Nightlights may not portray an accurate picture of the ground truth due to policy constraints, e.g. some Nordic countries turn off street lights at night to protect birds.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another approach is to abstract the GDP level using an assortiment of weighting methods. This approach is also known as the \"Gross Cell Product\" (GCP) measure. However, it still has its fair share of limitations:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The GCP measure is computed on other various measures that might have severe inaccuracy, particularly when measuring developing countries where the data quality can be sometimes questionable.\n",
        "- The GCP is also subject to problems of missing data, particularly when used to measure developing countries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus an alternative approach is required if we were to go even lower to capture local economic development.\n"

        "\n",
        "One way I argue that we can measure local economic development is by using satellite images. Consider the case that we need to measure the level of local economic development of a city. We can look from above and count how many buildings are there in a city. Most people would agree that cities are more developed than rural areas, and thus all we need is to reframe the question and think about how much buildings/roads are there in an image vs. what portion of the image is a forest or other types of natural terrain untouched by human economic activity.\n",

        "- Presence of White/Gray Classes: The rural image has fewer buildings than the urban image. Buildings usually have gray or bright color roofs. In the urban image, that is much more common than the rural image.\n",
        "- Density of items: Items in the rural image are less densely packed than the urban image. In the urban image, the buildings are all closely stacked next to each oither. In other words, there are more lines separating buildings in the urban image. Shapes of buildings in the urban image also tend to be more rectangular than the fuzzly shaped farmlands and forests in the rural image.\n",

The segmentation task can also be applied to object detection, and that variant is called **instance segmentation**.\n",
